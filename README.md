# isOnlineUtil
## Intro
This is a utility for checking if youtube URLs in a given TSV (or CSV) are available in [VGMVersus](https://github.com/adsuth/VGMVersus) or [VGMB](https://github.com/adsuth/VGMB). It does this by checking the video's metadata via the Youtube API.

Currently, the utility can only flag **deleted** videos, **not copyrighted ones**.

Upon completion, the program will output an HTML file to `./index.html`, that can then be opened on a web browser like Chrome.

## Dependencies
To run this utility, you'll need to install the required dependencies.
run this command to do

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note that the token (token.pickle) will be placed **outside the isOnlineUtil directory**, so make sure you keep it safe.
